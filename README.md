FIREBASE
=====================

This is the simple example for Firebase.

## Uploading pictures to Firebase

Before we dive into Firebase, let's understand what Firebase does.
Firebase provides various features to developers, such as real time
databases, cloud messaging, authentication, storage etc.
These services can be integrated with your application of varous platforms
such as IOS, Android and the Web.

Navigate to the Firebase website in your browser and, if already registered with the service, 
log in to your account (if you're not registered then go and create your account, it's free!)

* Let's begin creating a brand new project
* Once your project has been created you can choose how to add Firebase to your application
 (Add Firebase to your web app)
* From the modal window that appears, copy the following configuration keys and values

Please set your firebase configuration in index.html : 
```bash
apiKey: "***************************************",
authDomain: "*****-*****.firebaseapp.com",
databaseURL: "https://**-*****.firebaseio.com",
projectId: "*****-******",
storageBucket: "******-******.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId: "*******"
```
* Once copied paste these configuration keys/values into a file

More info on this can be found on the Firebase [Getting Started](https://firebase.google.com/) page.
